# 📂 Django File Organizer

A simple **Django + Bootstrap** web application to organize and visualize your local folders.  
Users can upload a folder (or enter its path) and the app will **analyze and categorize files** into structured folders.  
The UI shows an **accordion-style preview** of how the folder will look before changes are applied.
